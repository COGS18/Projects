## COGS18: Project Grading Rubric
* In general, we are not aiming for particularly harsh grading. If they spent time and effort engaging in the project, they should get a passing grade.
* Sections aren't all or none - unless they totally didn't do something, give them some proportion of the section, matching the extent to which they did or didn't do the required thing.
* Keep in mind the students' context. Though you might know a better way to do something, it is not necessarily fair to expect them to know that. Keep the course materials in mind in terms of evaluating what they should know how to do.

### Concept (total: 5 points)

| Points        | Requirement          					   |
| -------------: |:--------------------------------------------|
| 5             | They chose a project topic from either the assignment list, or an independent topic they can write code for 		 | 

### File Structure (total: 5 points)

| Points        | Requirement          					   |
| -------------: |:--------------------------------------------|
| 1.5             | There is at least one Jupyter notebook file		 | 
| 1.5             | There is at least one python file		 | 
| 2             | Files are interpretably organized (not necessarily same as template)		 | 


### Project Description (total: 10 points)

| Points        | Requirement          					   |
| -------------: |:--------------------------------------------|
| 2.5             | There is a project description in a Jupyter notebook		 | 
| 7.5             | The project description is a self-contained explanation of the project. It provides a description of what they are trying to do.		 | 


### Approach (total: 20 points)

| Points        | Requirement          					   |
| -------------: |:--------------------------------------------|
| 5             | The design they chose responds to the project topic they outlined	| 
| 5             | Original code meets project requirements (3 functions; 2 Classes w/ 1+ method;  2 functions + 1 Class)	| 
| 10             | The code / approaches / algorithms they used for their project are appropriate for the task they trying to complete	 | 


### Code (total: 30 points)

| Points        | Requirement          					   |
| -------------: |:--------------------------------------------|
| 5             | Variables & Code Constructs: they use variables and control flow constructs in their code, as needed| 
| 5             | Functions & Classes: code is organized into functions; Use of classes is optional |
| 5             | Modular Organization: at least some code is organized into an external module, and this file is well constructed |
| 5             | Imports & Libraries: they import code from the module, and use external libraries if & when appropriate. |
| 10             | The code is functional - it does what it is supposed to, with no major errors or bugs, and works as intended. |

| -------------: |:--------------------------------------------|
| 7            | There are numpy format docstrings on functions & classes Needs: first line sentence, parameters & returns sections | 
| 3             | There are (at least some) inline comments that explain the code  |


### Tests (total: 10 points)

| Points        | Requirement          					   |
| -------------: |:--------------------------------------------|
| 2.5             | Has asserts that are used to test some property of the code | 
| 2.5             | These are organized into a well formed test file |
| 2.5             | Tests are organized into well formed test functions |
| 2.5             | The tests execute |

**Fudge points (up to 10 points)**

Use these to offset projects that are strong but lose points due to the rubric. Explain why these were granted in the comments section. You can award up to 10 points to offset points lost to the rubric when you feel a project was strong. This should NOT be used as extra credit. I anticipate these being applied sparingly. Most projects will have 0 fudge points. Project should not be >100 points after applying fudge points.

**Extra Credit (up to 4 points)**

Awarded for going above and beyond. Students should have an explanation of how they went above and beyond in their notebook to be eligible for extra credit (however, if this is missing and you feel their project is very strong, feel free to award extra credit). This could include using packages/modules not discussed in class, learning something new, or generally going well beyond the requirements of the project. The max possible project score should be 104.
