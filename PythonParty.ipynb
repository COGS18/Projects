    "**Q&A**\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: is there an easy way to download all the lecture notes from datahub using code in the terminal on my computer?  \n",
    "A: Yes - you can zip/tar all the contents on datahub into a single file, download, and then unzip/untar on your computer. I will provide instructions on this at the end of the quarter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I was using cat, and it wasn't printing anything out even though I know that new_file was placed within dir_name. Is there a reason for this?  \n",
    "A: This is likely b/c you didn't add any contents to that file. Open that file up, add some text, and try `cat` again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: I still don't understand the purpose of using the command line.   \n",
    "A: Quickly navigate to and organize files. Also, run python scripts (we'll be doing this today).\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Why can't we just stick to jupyter for an intro class  \n",
    "A: Because understanding how to work with .py files is critical for moving forward/understanding other code you see out in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What does `!cd ~/` do?  \n",
    "A: Takes you to your home directory. If you're already in your home directory...it will leave you where you are.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How do we use the command line directly on our computer, like in our computer's terminal?   \n",
    "A: Search for \"terminal\" on your computer (if you don't have a terminal application already installed (depends on your computer), you could download a \"bash shell\". (I use iTerm.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What is the difference between shell command and command line? Is there a difference?  \n",
    "A: The command line is where you type shell commands. So, when you open up a terminal and get the black background, that is the command line. One thing you can do at the command line is type shell commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Is the command line somewhere we are able to write code or is it purely used for locating files, documents, and code that has already been written? A follow-up question if we don't write code in the command line would be where would we write code then? Just in another Jupyter Notebook file that we then retrieve using the command line?  \n",
    "A: In a text editor! (The part of the notes we didn't get to on Wednesday but will discuss today.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: How is array different from other collections (like tuples, lists, dictionaries)?  \n",
    "A: We'll discuss arrays next week when we discuss `numpy`, but for now, arrays can be N-dimensional."
